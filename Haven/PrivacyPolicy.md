2. How your Personal Information will be Used
</h2>

Haven will seek your consent if we want to use your Personal Information for purposes other than for those set out in this Privacy Policy or to which you have previously agreed.
 
We do not use, commercialize, sell, license, rent, trade, or otherwise disclose your Personal Information without your consent except where required or permitted by law.
 
We may disclose Personal Information to technical service providers to operate or maintain the App or the Services. We may provide aggregate statistics about our services, customers, traffic patterns, and other information to third parties, but these statistics will not include any information that could personally identify you.

3. How We Store Your Personal Information
</h2>

Haven’s standard practice is to permanently delete all data, including your Personal Information, within 30 days of account termination. However, we will keep your Personal Information for as long as necessary to achieve the identified purpose or as required by law, which may extend beyond the termination of our App or Service relationship with you. All retained Personal Information will remain subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
 
<h2>
4. User Identifying Data
</h2>
  
The Haven App stores and transmits small amounts of User identifying data to ensure proper operation of the Services, to remember your login information, and to personalize your experience on the Haven App. This data is a small piece of information that our servers automatically send for storage on your mobile phone device, which then permits our servers to recall information about your preferences. 
 
We do not use, commercialize, sell, license, rent, trade, or otherwise disclose your User Identifying Data without your consent except where required or permitted by law.

<h2>
5. Accessing and Changing Your Personal Information
</h2>

You have the right to access the Personal Information that we collect and to request a correction if you believe that the stored Personal Information is inaccurate. If you would like to access or would like to change your Personal Information, please contact us at support@havensafe.co. We will respond to requests within the time allowed by applicable privacy laws and will make every effort to respond as accurately and completely as possible.

<h2>
6. How We Protect Your Personal Information
</h2>  

We are fully committed to ensuring that your Personal Information is secure. Each of the features in our Services has a unique storage and industry-standard encryption system to ensure that your Personal Information is safe.
 
When you activate the Haven App, all audio data captured by the Services is initially stored on your mobile phone device. We encourage you to have a strong password in place on your mobile phone device to protect this data and the other data on your mobile phone device.
 
Your mobile phone device will frequently upload to the cloud via an OAuthSSL and HTTPS encrypted transfer. Audio files are uploaded and saved the same way. All location tracking GPS data, and any Personal Information about you that we collect is passed through a third-party server and gets stored on a third-party storage platform. All the data is again passed via an SSL encrypted connection.
 
Despite our diligent efforts to secure your Personal Information, understand that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. If you have any questions about security on our Site, you can contact us at: support@havensafe.co.
